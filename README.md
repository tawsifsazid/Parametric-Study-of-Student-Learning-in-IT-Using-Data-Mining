# Parametric-Study-of-Student-Learning-in-IT-Using-Data-Mining-to-Improve-Academic-Performance

Learning using IT is one of the most widely used methods for the education in modern days. Now-a-days education system is turning into the digital learning technique. Digital learning gives students an experience of individual learning at any time as well as anywhere, so students get more interest, flexibility at learning. Knowing the preferences of students learning will help the instructors to better design learning materials and teaching styles.We have surveyed on almost 500 students in undergraduate level and evaluated the students in three categories: good, average and excellent. We have used four classification models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree and Random Forest (RF) model to predict performance of students on basis of the impact of IT and other study mediums based on their CGPA. Parametric functions are an essential topic in mathematics and science which enable us to take a problem in several dimensions and reduce it to several problems in one dimension. So, we have represented in a way that found the model which can give better accuracy of studentâ€™s performance and also can find out  which parameters or sectors of IT and other study mediums are playing a great role in their academic results.
